           <p>They gathered round the camp fire for warmth. It was cold outside and camping was never a warm affair, especially at night. Tim threw more firewood into the fire, he hated cold more than anyone there. This was due to his trip to North Atlantic. He slipped into the icy water once and it took a lot of jumpers, jackets and warm cocoa just to get back to normal temperature. He shivered a little just thinking about it. All the kids moved a little closer for warmth and chatted about the adventure they had that day as they made jests about how Bob had climbed up a tree thinking he had seen a snake, when in reality he had simply seen a really thin twig. His climbing the tree actually got him closer to an actual snake and he fell down and bruised his knee and his ego. He hated the kids joking about his ordeal, but he knew he would laugh about it in a week or so, just not today.</p>
           <br>
           <p>Papa, as they called him, was an old man, he was their grandfather, but he moved like his sons and was as fit as a fiddle. He kept to a strict diet and regiment and believed he was going to live to 120, so far, so good. He sat down in front of the kids as his two sons, Tim and Bob found a place around the camp fire."Story, story!" Akila, the youngest and the one with the most life shouted. She loved Papa's stories. Even though she could not tell whether they were factual or fictional, she still loved them</p>
