      <p>Life is always full of surprises and the white fox is not unfamilar to this. He has always been a sly one, the smartest of his pack. The quickest and also witty. However, despite all his abilities, he could not outdo his latest challenge.
      Despite this, the white fox always loved a challenge. I mean, what is life but a series of challenges thrown at you? The fox knew this, so did the world. However, he was not going to let that stop him. Of course he would have to figure out how to get rid of the coat that looked incriminating. He surely did not do it. How could he? He loved the man. He simply wanted to ask for his blessing for her daughter's hand in marriage. "I swear! I found him like this when I got here." He thought of what to say if he was caught there by the village. But, have those words ever sounded innocent? He was not going to be exiled. Not today at least. So, he hatched a plan.

      <p>It was a cold Friday morning, it always was around these parts. But the sun was never bashful, not in Africa. It always swept in around 7am? Who knows. No one defined time in numbers, not yet at least. Rafiki, woke up as soon as the sun rays struck his cheek. This was actually the first time. Usually, he beats the sun to it. This time, however, he was sluggish. He was not fond of being late. After all, who is going to feed his rabbits if it were not for him. Those rodents ate and they sure did it a lot. Probably explains why they multiplied by the hundreds. "Thank God, human beings do not procreate like rodents!" Rafiki thought to himself as he fed those long eared animals. He watched them scramble for the dried cabbages he put in a bowl. For animals who have heard stories written about their cunning nature, they are not very smart creatures in person.</p>
