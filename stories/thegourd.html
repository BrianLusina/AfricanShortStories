          <p>Not many tales are told of a gourd. In fact not many care to tell the tale of pottery, cutlery and crockery. The are regarded lifeless, with not soul. How can material things hold life or art or truth? Aren't they just to be used and discarded when they become old and worn? Then we get new ones and the process is repeated. As much as they are just <em>things</em>, they do make life easier. They are but tools. However, Edilia did not think of her gourd as just a tool. To her it held truth, memories and art that only she could ever understand. The gourd <em>spoke</em> to her. She could only understand what truth it told her. "Why is this old gourd so important to you anyway? It is old, looks dusty and I can see a crack on it. You know you can get a new one, right?" Limo told her as he helped her pack. She was moving house, but there was no way she was leaving without it. He had tried to convince her to discard it before. Telling her how moving house marks a new beginning and the gourd just looks centuries old."It may be old and developing crevices, but it does not make it unimportant to me. I am moving with it." She told her as she held his hand and looked deeply into his eyes. She always did this when she wanted to change the topic and have her way It worked almost all the time. Except the one time, when he was livid about his boss treating him like a slave."Alright, we shall move with it, if you tell me why it is the most important gourd of all time," he replied as he noticed that she was playing her <em>card game</em> again</p>
