          <p>Life is always full of surprises and the white fox is not unfamilar to this. He has always been a sly one, the smartest of his pack. The quickest and also witty. However, despite all his abilities, he could not outdo his latest challenge.
      Despite this, the white fox always loved a challenge. I mean, what is life but a series of challenges thrown at you? The fox knew this, so did the world. However, he was not going to let that stop him. Of course he would have to figure out how to get rid of the coat that looked incriminating. He surely did not do it. How could he? He loved the man. He simply wanted to ask for his blessing for her daughter's hand in marriage. "I swear! I found him like this when I got here." He thought of what to say if he was caught there by the village. But, have those words ever sounded innocent? He was not going to be exiled. Not today at least. So, he hatched a plan...</p>

          <p>Kings. We do not have many of them in these present times, but we can still feel their prescence from days of old. Well, technically having a president ruling a country can somewhat be almost similar to having a king. The only difference is that they (presidents) can be voted in and out of office, kings on the other hand, can only be removed from power when they lose in battle, or when they die and their heirs take over. Hmm... Actually, the people have no say in the ruling of kings. They are autocratical, ruthless, vicious. Some of them at least. But, not all of them are. They like to think of themselves as gods. They really aren't. They know it, but they want the people to never know it. After all the ruled have no say in matters regarding the rulers. But, is this always the case?...</p>

          <p>This has to be one of the oldest stories ever told. Think about it. It is about a smart wise turtle who beats the quick witty rabbit to the end of the finish line because the turtle plays to its strengths and banks on the rabbits haughty nature to win the race. It is meant to teach children and adults alike that being proud of your strengths and knowing them fully does not mean you will always win the  race. Occasionally you will meet a challenge that will find a way to beat you even when it looks like you are the clear winner. Pretty simple right? What if the story was turned on its head? Instead of the underdog turtle winning, the rabbit takes the day. Would the moral still be learnt? Or will we just accept that the apparent strongest will always win the race?....</p>

I told you to be careful with this one." Harim told his brother. Harim was never known for withholding his thoughts, even though they seemed cruel and mean. He always said what he felt needed to be said. After all, the truth shall set you free. "He is not like the devil, he is a cheeky small boy, still trying to find himself," the father tried to defend the small boy even though deep down he knew that he did not fully believe his own words. Regardless, he was his son and he had a responsibility of making sure he grew up to be a strong independent man. A man who was supposed to be better than him. But this destructive path was not helping his cause. He was not only embarassing him but also his family's name. Suddenly, a loud bang was heard outside <strong>BANG!</strong> The two old men jumped up to their feet. "I hope that is not what I think it is!" Harim said as he rushed outside. Musa, the brother, quickly followed him outside...</p>

          <p>Not many tales are told of a gourd. In fact not many care to tell the tale of pottery, cutlery and crockery. The are regarded lifeless, with not soul. How can material things hold life or art or truth? Aren't they just to be used and discarded when they become old and worn? Then we get new ones and the process is repeated. As much as they are just <em>things</em>, they do make life easier. They are but tools. However, Edilia did not think of her gourd as just a tool. To her it held truth, memories and art that only she could ever understand. The gourd <em>spoke</em> to her. She could only understand what truth it told her. "Why is this old gourd so important to you anyway? It is old, looks dusty and I can see a crack on it. You know you can get a new one, right?" Limo told her as he helped her pack. She was moving house, but there was no way she was leaving without it. He had tried to convince her to discard it before. Telling her how moving house marks a new beginning and the gourd just looks centuries old."It may be old and developing crevices, but it does not make it unimportant to me. I am moving with it." She told her as she held his hand and looked deeply into his eyes. She always did this when she wanted to change the topic and have her way It worked almost all the time. Except the one time, when he was livid about his boss treating him like a slave."Alright, we shall move with it, if you tell me why it is the most important gourd of all time"...</p>

          <p>Naliaka was not too fond of travelling. She used to love it as a child, but not anymore, she wished she could teleport. One second you're here and the next you're half way across the world. That would be simply fantastic, she could see her parents who had been nagging her to go home to visit and then see her brother who has a new born son and then be able to make her trip to China all in one day. She always wanted to go to China. The culture simply fascinated her and she wanted to have a chance to experience it on her own. She saw the teleportation ability in a movie once, "he just looked at a photo of Paris and then <em>poof</em> he was there!" She told her good friend Najoli who she met with in town at a cafe during lunch hour. "I think I have seen that movie before. It must be nice to be at 10 places in a day and not break a sweat! However, you lose the chance to enjoy the scenery along the way to your destination." Najoli replied as she sipped her coffee, she still never quite understood the fascination with coffee these days.</p>
          <br>
          <p>"Besides, the journey is always better than reaching the destination in under a second." Najolu continued as she swallowed that dark substance. She almost teared a little. "I am just always busy with work, being able to meet all these social obligations in a day, sounds like a major win." Naliaka was never known to be as optimistic as Najoli, she was always <em>cautiously</em> optimistic, it helped her maintain a sort of clarity and keep in touch with reality...</p>

          <p>The chameleon was at it again. Blending in was always its skill. Insects never saw it coming. One minute it is living its short life buzzing here and there, the next it is trying to fight the clutches of a sticky tongue. They always fall for it. Even despite knowing what kills them, they still <em>hang</em> around. I suppose it is what mother nature intended so that life can be sustained. This was not the only sneaky trait of the chameleon. It has eyes that allow a sort of 360 view, this coupled with its firm grip, it was clearly a formidable prey for insects. But its sluggish movement was just something nature had to give it just to balance things out.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The praying mantis however was not as slow as the chameleon, it was quite fast and it killed with ferocity. It is slender, but it is not an enemy you want to encounter on its <em>good day</em>. Despite being in the seemingly small ecosystem together, these two rarely met. But nature had different plans...</p>

          <p>Hiking. Not Mathew's favorite activity. In fact, if he had it any other way, he would be in the valley lying on his back on a picnic mat as his girlfriend told him of her long week and her female workmates who always seemed to be scheming for one reason or the other. "I was never good news, I wonder why she can't just get another job then", Mathew thought to himself as he fastened the heavy backpack on his back. They hike was going to be long and treacherous, but he was prepared, mentally at least. Physically, he would just have to sweat out the pain. They said this mountain had never been conquered, Mathew was not even going to test that theory, he was just doing this to get his girlfriend of his back about not being <em>adventuruous</em>. He decided this had to be done to at least to make her stop nagging him constantly. So, he picked Mt. Susa. The tallest in his country. This was surely going to send a statement. But, when they got to the foot of the mountain, he quickly wondered whether he could have probably taken a second longer just to think about it...</p>

          <p>They gathered round the camp fire for warmth. It was cold outside and camping was never a warm affair, especially at night. Tim threw more firewood into the fire, he hated cold more than anyone there. This was due to his trip to North Atlantic. He slipped into the icy water once and it took a lot of jumpers, jackets and warm cocoa just to get back to normal temperature. He shivered a little just thinking about it. All the kids moved a little closer for warmth and chatted about the adventure they had that day as they made jests about how Bob had climbed up a tree thinking he had seen a snake, when in reality he had simply seen a really thin twig. His climbing the tree actually got him closer to an actual snake and he fell down and bruised his knee and his ego. He hated the kids joking about his ordeal, but he knew he would laugh about it in a week or so, just not today.</p>

He kept to a strict diet and regiment and believed he was going to live to 120, so far, so good. He sat down in front of the kids as his two sons, Tim and Bob found a place around the camp fire."Story, story!" Akila, the youngest and the one with the most life shouted. She loved Papa's stories. Even though she could not tell whether they were factual or fictional, she still loved them...</p>

          <p>"You are making the rest of us look stupid Ben," Robert told his brother as he approached the tree. "That is not possible, you do that very well on you're own," Ben replied as he put the book aside. 'God's Favorite Idiot' was the title. Robert looked at the title and then looked at his brother, "you are smart, I do not think that book is about you." He sat down next to his brother and the sat their in silence for one minute as they looked at the sun rise in the east. It was always a beautiful site. No matter how many times one looked at it. "God favors every one equaly," Ben then finally said as he stretched as if had just been awoken from a slumber."Brother, I do not think you know what you are saying, but I shall let you have this one for now, we have quite the day ahead,"...</p>
